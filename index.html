</head>
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> August 17, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your data is collected, used, and shared when you operate or interact with the Panda × Gorilla autopilot content engine (“Panda × Gorilla,” “we,” “us”). The system is designed for **your own content creation and posting** on YouTube Shorts (and optionally TikTok, Instagram Reels).</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OAuth Credentials:</strong> We temporarily store OAuth access tokens (e.g. YouTube) in the n8n platform for automated uploads. Tokens are not extracted or transferred outside your workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Media Files:</strong> Audio (Panda/Gorilla voices) and generated video files are processed and stored temporarily for upload. We do <em>not</em> persist these files—n8n and your hosting environment manage them.</li>
    <li><strong>Scripts:</strong> Text generated by OpenAI-like services (Flowith) is used only to produce your content. We do not store or aggregate them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To generate short-form video content using Flowith (script), ElevenLabs (TTS), and send it to platforms via OAuth (upload to your channel/account).</li>
    <li>To render videos via Creatomate using your audio and captions; no data is used for any other purpose.</li>
    <li>Optionally, to log upload metadata (titles, timestamps, platform) in a Google Sheet, if enabled by you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We integrate with third-party APIs: Flowith, ElevenLabs, Cloudinary (or other media host), Creatomate, YouTube Data API, TikTok API, Instagram Graph API, and optionally Google Sheets. We do not transfer or store your personal account details beyond what is required for access tokens.</li>
    <li>These services’ own privacy practices apply—please review their documentation separately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access tokens remain active until revoked by you via n8n or your platform account.</li>
    <li>Generated media files are not stored long-term and are deleted automatically after posting (unless configured otherwise in your workflow).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke access tokens anytime via your Google Account (YouTube) or TikTok/Meta account settings.</li>
    <li>If we ever contain logs or other metadata on your platform, you can request deletion by emailing <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out at <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a>.</p>
